\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

The system was tested with 82 images that contained banknotes in the most common conditions, such as different perspective views, cluttered environments, multiple banknotes per image and partially occluded banknotes. With the proper configuration (specified in [28]), the system successfully recognize all test images. Below are some of the representative results.
