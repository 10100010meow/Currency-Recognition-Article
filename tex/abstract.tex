Robust banknote recognition in different perspective views and in dynamic lighting conditions is critical for detecting counterfeit banknotes in ATMs and help visual impaired people. The computer vision system developed can recognize multiple banknotes in different perspective views and scales, even when they are part of cluttered environments in which the lighting conditions may vary considerably. The system is also able to recognize banknotes that are partially visible, folded, wrinkled or even worn by usage. To accomplish this task, the system relies on image processing algorithms, such as image preprocessing, feature detection, description and matching. To improve the confidence in the recognition results, the contour of the banknotes is computed using a homography, and its shape is analyzed to make sure that it belongs to a banknote. The system successfully recognized 82 test images having all Euro banknotes, even when there were several overlapping banknotes in the same test image.
